# Old School RuneScape Deob Client some info:
* To change the codebase [IP] to w.e you want to you can find it in: `runescape-client/src/test/resources/jav_config.ws`
* To change RSA-Key it's located at: `runescape-client/src/main/java/class67.java` Line: 33
* Make sure to only use `rsc-run` Gradle task.
* OPRS Launcher won't work so only use of this to use it as a deob.
* I already did some refactoring and will still continue doing it and commiting them till i get bored of RSPS again.
